0.2.0
=====
- The plugin now supports a variety of archive managers through a generic
  interface, that requires the archive manager to install a .desktop file
  as usual, that lists the supported mime types, and a .tap file that acts

  parameters for the create, extract-here and extract-to actions.

  KDE archive manager) have been added. Xarchiver, the Xfce archive manager,
